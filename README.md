## INTRO  


### Climate & Weather Data Visualization Project  

Welcome to the Climate & Weather Data Visualization Project! This project aims to analyze and visualize historical weather data for Athens, Greece, using the Meteostat API. By exploring various weather metrics such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, sunshine duration, and air pressure, we can gain insights into climate trends over the years.  
  



### Objectives  
The primary objectives of this project include:  
  

- Data Collection: Scraping and processing weather data for Athens from the Meteostat API, focusing on a time span from 2000 to 2023.  
  

 
- Data Analysis: Calculating key statistics, such as average temperatures (both summer and winter), maximum and minimum temperatures, and mean values for precipitation, wind speed, sunshine, and air pressure.
  
  

- Data Visualization: Creating engaging and informative visualizations using Matplotlib and Plotly to illustrate the trends and patterns in the weather data.   
  



### Technologies Used  
- Python: The primary programming language used for data scraping, processing, and analysis. 🐍🐍🐍  
  

- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis. 🐼🐼🐼  
  

- Meteostat API: For accessing historical weather data. ☀️⛅⚡  
  

- Matplotlib: For static data visualization. 📈📉💹  
  

- Plotly: For interactive data visualization.📊📊📊
